## Requirements

> **Note:** Branches for Swift 2.3 ([`swift-2.3`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/tree/swift-2.3)) and 3.0 ([`swift-3.0`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/tree/swift-3.0)) are being kept up-to-date as Xcode 8 betas are released.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.0.0+ is required to build PinpointKit.

To integrate PinpointKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'PinpointKit', '~> 0.9'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate PinpointKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "Lickability/PinpointKit" ~> 0.9
```

- Run `carthage update` to build the framework.
- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the “Targets” heading in the sidebar.
- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the “General” panel.
- Drag the built `PinpointKit.framework` from the Carthage build folder into the “Embedded Binaries” section.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate PinpointKit into your project manually.

#### Embedded Framework

- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level project directory, and run the following command if your project is not initialized as a git repository:

```bash
$ git init
```

- Add PinpointKit as a git [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by running the following command:

```bash
$ git submodule add -b master https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit.git
```

- Open the new `PinpointKit/PinpointKit` folder, and drag the `PinpointKit.xcodeproj` into the Project Navigator of your application’s Xcode project.

    > It should appear nested underneath your application’s blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.

- Select the `PinpointKit.xcodeproj` in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target.
- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the “Targets” heading in the sidebar.
- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the “General” panel.
- Click on the `+` button under the “Embedded Binaries” section.    
- You will see two different `PinpointKit.xcodeproj` folders each with two different versions of the `PinpointKit.framework` nested inside a Products folder.
- Select the top `PinpointKit.framework` for iOS.

- And that’s it!

The `PinpointKit.framework` is automatically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a “Copy Files” build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.

## Usage

Once PinpointKit is installed, it’s simple to use.

Initialize an instance of [`PinpointKit`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/PinpointKit.swift), specifying an array of feedback recipients used to pre-populate email addresses to which feedback can be sent:

```swift
let pinpointKit = PinpointKit(feedbackRecipients: ["feedback@example.com"])
```

To display a feedback view controller, add the following code where you want the feedback to display, passing the view controller from which [`PinpointKit`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/PinpointKit.swift) should present:

```swift
pinpointKit.show(fromViewController: viewController)
```
> **Note:** Be sure to keep a strong reference to your instance of [`PinpointKit`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/PinpointKit.swift) for the duration of its use.

If you want to have the feedback view display from a shake gesture, simply add the following to your application delegate, replacing `["feedback@example.com"]` with your array of email recipients:

```swift
private let pinpointKit = PinpointKit(feedbackRecipients: ["feedback@example.com"])
lazy var window: UIWindow? = ShakeDetectingWindow(frame: UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds, delegate: self.pinpointKit)
```

If you don’t want to use [`PinpointKit`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/PinpointKit.swift)’s default configuration, you can specify both [`Configuration`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/Configuration.swift) and [`PinpointKitDelegate`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/PinpointKit.swift) instances on initialization of [`PinpointKit`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/PinpointKit.swift).

The [`Configuration`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/Configuration.swift) struct allows you to specify how the feedback view looks and behaves, while the [`PinpointKitDelegate`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/PinpointKit.swift) instance provides hooks into the state of the feedback being sent.

## Customization

PinpointKit uses a protocol-oriented architecture which allows almost everything to be customized. Here are some examples of what’s possible:

* Implement a `JIRASender` that conforms to [`Sender`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/Sender.swift), allowing users to send feedback directly into your bug tracker.
* Supply your own console log collector that aggregates messages from your third-party logging framework of choice by conforming to [`LogCollector`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/LogCollector.swift)
* Change how logs are viewed by creating your own view controller conforming to [`LogViewer`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/LogViewer.swift).

For more information on what you can customize, take a peek the documentation of [`Configuration`](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit/blob/master/PinpointKit/PinpointKit/Sources/Configuration.swift).
